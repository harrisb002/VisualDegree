Films are cultural artifacts and the meanings we bring to our viewing and spectatorship are deeply affected by the social context of their consumption. In the US, racial capitalism and racism inform much of the context and creation of cinema. Applying an interdisciplinary ethnic studies approach, this course investigates the narrative and visual contours of storytelling and cultures of resistance in both mainstream (Hollywood) and alternative cinemas. We will supplement our inquiry through related works of literature (short story, poetry, and drama) in addition to readings in film theory, film history, cultural and Ethnic studies.",

The main purpose of this course is to study the progression of economic thought in order to gain a better understanding of economic theory in the present and future. This course begins with discussing the economic ideas of the \"great masters\" of economics: Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Marshall, and Walras. Economic thought associated with the early 20th century transition and modern era masters such as Keynes, Fisher, and Schumpeter are introduced next. In addition to these modern era masters, there will be many others to touch upon along the way to Keynes and thereafter. The course shifts after studying Keynes to a focus on modern economics, where the Keynesian and Monetarist schools of thought dominated most of the twentieth century's latter half. Economic thought of Friedman, Lucas, Sargent, Tobin, Minsky, Shiller, and others are discussed in class. The class concludes with a consideration of current economic issues such as fiscal and monetary policies, unemployment, and globalization.",

  "description": "Economists understand firm behavior by applying a simple rule for profit maximization: Marginal Revenue equals Marginal Cost. Models of perfect competition and monopoly are the simplest applications of this rule, but fail to explain many of the things firms do in real markets. Industrial Organization (IO) is motivated by observed deviations from the classical models of perfect competition and monopoly. Topics include models of price discrimination, product differentiation, oligopoly, entry deterrence, collusion, etc. in order to understand how different market institutions lead to different restatements of the profit maximization rule.",

  "description": "Economics is the study of how people make choices in a world with constraints. In Neoclassical models, behavior is based on assumptions that may or may not be true. Behavioral economics, on the other hand, takes as its starting point actual behavior (observed either experimentally or in naturally occurring situations), using observations to incorporate more realistic psychological foundations. Typically this means enriching the theory rather than replacing it. Experimental methods are particularly useful in this kind of research.",

Students will understand why public schools embodied contentious values, who the important players were, and the roots of school structures. Similar to other institutions subject to cycles of reform and reaction, schools often embody unexamined traditions and unconscious rituals. Over time schools develop an internal momentum that sometimes deflects naive reform efforts: history can thus offer perspectives on obstinate and enigmatic issues regarding educational policy and practice. Throughout the course we will attempt to understand what intellectuals were thinking about public education and what ordinary people were experiencing in them. Within this context, we will assess how differences of race, class, gender, ethnicity and power shaped public schools. A basic premise of the course is that we are living with decisions in public schools that were made in the past.",

Students will reflect on their personal and professional experiences in education in light of these larger conceptual frameworks in order to examine assumptions about the purposes and practices of schooling. Overarching themes throughout the course include the role of schooling in a democratic society, how schools as institutions both maintain and disrupt inequities, and what it means to be an educator who challenges oppression.",

Lectures introduce the ecological, scientific and societal issues associated with major environmental issues of our time, such as land-use change, biodiversity loss, and global carbon emissions. These issues are then quantitatively analyzed with real-world spatial datasets using GIS-based methods and tools in coordinated laboratory exercises. In the process, students extend and strengthen GIS skills and concepts acquired through GEP 387.",

  "description": "This course offers an introduction to the social scientific theories that influence the study of human development. We consider a range of social scientific theories on political economy, culture, psychology, and biology. We then go on to examine how theorists of the life course have drawn on this classic social scientific work, as well as the possibilities for additional theoretical interchange. The course emphasizes the close reading and discussion of texts representative of major approaches.",

Key topics include how to make these settings more collaborative, how expertise gets constructed and interpreted in these contexts, the (ironic) risk of reinforcing inequities around race and class through \"service\", and the gendered political economy of \"service\" labor. This is a service-learning class that requires students to work with a local community partner on issues of community health.",

  "title": "Unequal Childhoods in the United States",
  "description": "This course examines how the experience of childhood is shaped by processes of marginalization, minoritization and racialization, considered particularly in the context of the United States. On the one hand, the class considers how individuals, from infancy through adolescence, come to be socialized into a world characterized by power-laden social difference. Special topics of concern include the forms of social difference salient for children (e.g., race, class, disability) as well as the institutions and forms of mediation that help to make that social difference salient (e.g., systems of adoption and foster care, educational institutions, and institutions of biomedicine). On the other hand, the class considers how these processes of socialization result in developmental outcomes of various sorts: deep vulnerabilities (e.g., in health and educational outcomes) but also resilience and new ways of flourishing.",

  "description": "Aging is one of the most unifying and even \"universal\" factors of human development; at the same time, it is a social process where the cumulative advantages of individuals and groups come to be most visible and socially impactful. In this course, we consider \"age\" and \"aging\" relative to broader issues about inequity and social justice, focusing particularly on the United States. We will take up differences in health, social and economic outcomes across aging populations as inflected by race, class, gender, and disability; we will also consider the public policies that shape these outcomes. The course is designed to provide students the opportunity for both live lecture/discussion and time to research specific topics that impact life satisfaction in a rapidly growing and widely diverse older population.",

  "description": "This course examines how language serves as a medium for the socialization of marginalization and racialization in contexts of immigration, understood as a process that occurs across the life course. The focus of the class is on Latinx populations in the United States. After first considering the some historical and theoretical background, we take up a series of life course moments that exemplify these processes: the role of children as translators for their families (i.e., as language brokers), raciolinguistic socialization in the school, language socialization processes in multilingual workplaces, forms of accent discrimination that adults face, and the challenge of aging in a second language, among other topics. A consistent topic of interest throughout the class is the ideologies that frame Latinx language practices as disordered; we also consider policy, theory and activism that attempts to re-shape these ideologies. Students will complete a final project in which they use our class discussions to analyze an interview they conduct.",

We take up ideas of disease and illness and the concept of the \"patient,\" among others, alongside a concern with the characteristic interactional routines of biomedicine (e.g., the medical interview). A second major theme of the class is the way in which these healing practices produce unequal health outcomes along lines of race and class as well as other forms of social difference, a theme we take up under the concept of \"medical pluralism.\" Students develop a final project and paper that considers themes of social justice in medicine.",

Students in this course will be prompted to reexamine many aspects of the received knowledges and practices surrounding \"mental health.\" Who and what distinguishes between mental \"health\" and \"illness\"? Is \"mental\" health/illness distinct from \"body\" or \"physical\" health/illness? Is culture separable and distinct from \"mind/body,\" or \"health/illness\"? Are mental illnesses universal/particular? Are certain categories or classes of persons, groups, or societies less or more \"protected\" from or \"vulnerable\" to certain mental illnesses? At the end of this course students will be able to view mental illness and health in culture through a critical integrated and interdisciplinary lens sensitive to embedded forms of local and individual knowledge, practice, health, suffering, and healing.<p></p>\n\n<p>",

  "description": "This course will build on ideas from your past statistics classes, focusing on linear and non-linear regression analysis, design of experiments and analysis of variance, non-parametric techniques and multiple comparison methods.  The building blocks are your knowledge of statistical inference and probability distributions and their behavior that you learned in Math 265 and 345.  In particular, knowledge of and proficiency with definitions, results, and probability distributions presented in Math 345 is expected upon entering Math 465.   Along the way, we'll learn about and use the programming language R, but no prior knowledge of it is needed. In order to best facilitate your learning, this course will employ active learning methods that support such activities.  At every class meeting, you will be asked to engage in classroom discussions, work on problems with peers in class, and actively engage with the material.  The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences published a result in July 2016 stating that \"classroom environments in which students are provided opportunities to engage in mathematical investigation, communication, and group problem-solving, while also receiving feedback on their work from both experts and peers, have a positive effect on learning.\" In the Math and Stats Department, we invite and welcome students from all educational and cultural backgrounds to join us in creating an active, collaborative learning community that celebrates the complexity, beauty, and applicability of mathematics and statistics.",

  "description": "The use of force is often considered to be the most effective form of power, yet nonviolent strategies of action can, in many cases, provide more efficient and successful means to achieve one's goals than the ultima ratio of violence. Those who rely on \"just war theory\" to advocate for the necessity of war should note that in the 20th century (and early 21st century), nonviolent forms of resistance to oppressive authority generated more profound social and political transformations than violence.  Most recently, direct nonviolent action has helped facilitate democratic transitions and is proving to be the most promising means to bring justice and overcome oppression in current struggles in Burma, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Western Sahara, Zimbabwe, and Belarus. This course will draw on a range of literature, theory, and case studies in international relations to examine these and other questions: \"When is nonviolence a preferable alternative, both ethically and strategically?\", \"How does the regime context (e.g., open society vs. dictatorship) influence the menu of nonviolent options?\", \"Why have some nonviolent movements been successful while others have failed?\", and \"What insights does the application of nonviolent action provide to the global community?\".",

Topic examples include: intersectional feminism, urban Indigenous women-led land rematriation, Indigenous resistance to the border, Black feminist abolition visions, music/poetry as resistance, local race and gender history, transnational feminisms, lived experiences of gender and race, reproductive justice, housing justice, Islam and feminism, Muslim and Arab organizing against militarism and racism, rape crisis and healing justice, Indigenous organizing against domestic violence, trans-Latina organizing, Filipino women's transnational organizing against oppression, and immigrant and undocumented community and power building.  Ultimately, this course seeks to familiarize SSU students with intersectional women of color-led feminisms and analytical language/vocabulary from the fields of Women's and Gender Studies and Comparative Ethnic Studies so that students can deepen their understanding of the social and political landscape in which we all live.",
