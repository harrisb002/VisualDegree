The main purpose of this course is to study the progression of economic thought in order to gain a better understanding of economic theory in the present and future. This course begins with discussing the economic ideas of the \"great masters\" of economics: Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Marshall, and Walras. Economic thought associated with the early 20th century transition and modern era masters such as Keynes, Fisher, and Schumpeter are introduced next. In addition to these modern era masters, there will be many others to touch upon along the way to Keynes and thereafter. The course shifts after studying Keynes to a focus on modern economics, where the Keynesian and Monetarist schools of thought dominated most of the twentieth century's latter half. Economic thought of Friedman, Lucas, Sargent, Tobin, Minsky, Shiller, and others are discussed in class. The class concludes with a consideration of current economic issues such as fiscal and monetary policies, unemployment, and globalization",

Behavioral economics, on the other hand, takes as its starting point actual behavior (observed either experimentally or in naturally occurring situations), using observations to incorporate more realistic psychological foundations. Typically this means enriching the theory rather than replacing it. Experimental methods are particularly useful in this kind of research",

Those who rely on \"just war theory\" to advocate for the necessity of war should note that in the 20th century (and early 21st century), nonviolent forms of resistance to oppressive authority generated more profound social and political transformations than violence.  Most recently, direct nonviolent action has helped facilitate democratic transitions and is proving to be the most promising means to bring justice and overcome oppression in current struggles in Burma, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Western Sahara, Zimbabwe, and Belarus. This course will draw on a range of literature, theory, and case studies in international relations to examine these and other questions: \"When is nonviolence a preferable alternative, both ethically and strategically?\", \"How does the regime context (e.g., open society vs. dictatorship) influence the menu of nonviolent options?\", \"Why have some nonviolent movements been successful while others have failed?\", and \"What insights does the application of nonviolent action provide to the global community?\"",

The building blocks are your knowledge of statistical inference and probability distributions and their behavior that you learned in Math 265 and 345.  In particular, knowledge of and proficiency with definitions, results, and probability distributions presented in Math 345 is expected upon entering Math 465.   Along the way, we'll learn about and use the programming language R, but no prior knowledge of it is needed. In order to best facilitate your learning, this course will employ active learning methods that support such activities.  At every class meeting, you will be asked to engage in classroom discussions, work on problems with peers in class, and actively engage with the material.  The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences published a result in July 2016 stating that \"classroom environments in which students are provided opportunities to engage in mathematical investigation, communication, and group problem-solving, while also receiving feedback on their work from both experts and peers, have a positive effect on learning.\" In the Math and Stats Department, we invite and welcome students from all educational and cultural backgrounds to join us in creating an active, collaborative learning community that celebrates the complexity, beauty, and applicability of mathematics and statistics",

How do different cultures define music differently? What are the cross-cultural elements of music? How does one go about making a career in music? How can one develop strategies to most effectively practice music? How can one develop strategies to achieve \"peak\" performances of music? How can one develop coping skills for stage fright, stress, anxiety and perform with joy and confidence? What wellness and lifestyle strategies are most effective in leading to a healthy, happy lifetime of music-making?",

What role did political organization play in encouraging or restraining violence? In what ways do different cultural mores (honour, glory, greed, masculinity, etc.) incite violent behavior, or are these merely post facto  explanations?

They will, however, provide a framework for understanding some of the critical issues at stake in the discussion of the Jewish Diaspora experience, including: cultural and religious adaptability, social boundary flexibility and maintenance, and ambivalence surrounding the question of where home is",

  "department": "Education: Multiple Subject",
  "description": "This course provides an overview of the history of American public schools as we explore several major reform movements from the common school movement to the Civil Rights Era of the 1960s and 1970s and then up through the present. Students will understand why public schools embodied contentious values, who the important players were, and the roots of school structures. Similar to other institutions subject to cycles of reform and reaction, schools often embody unexamined traditions and unconscious rituals. Over time schools develop an internal momentum that sometimes deflects naive reform efforts: history can thus offer perspectives on obstinate and enigmatic issues regarding educational policy and practice. Throughout the course we will attempt to understand what intellectuals were thinking about public education and what ordinary people were experiencing in them. Within this context, we will assess how differences of race, class, gender, ethnicity and power shaped public schools. A basic premise of the course is that we are living with decisions in public schools that were made in the past",

Applying an interdisciplinary ethnic studies approach, this course investigates the narrative and visual contours of storytelling and cultures of resistance in both mainstream (Hollywood) and alternative cinemas.

With its perspective on broad spatial and temporal scales, Biogeography is particularly relevant for designing viable long-term strategies for nature conservation in the face of modern human-induced changes, such as global warming and habitat conversion. This course uses lectures, reading assignments and an individual student project to explore past and present biota at regional to global scales, and a field trip to understand our local northern California ecosystems",

Special topics of concern include the forms of social difference salient for children (e.g., race, class, disability) as well as the institutions and forms of mediation that help to make that social difference salient (e.g., systems of adoption and foster care, educational institutions, and institutions of biomedicine). On the other hand, the class considers how these processes of socialization result in developmental outcomes of various sorts: deep vulnerabilities (e.g., in health and educational outcomes) but also resilience and new ways of flourishing",

We will take up differences in health, social and economic outcomes across aging populations as inflected by race, class, gender, and disability; we will also consider the public policies that shape these outcomes.

After first considering the some historical and theoretical background, we take up a series of life course moments that exemplify these processes: the role of children as translators for their families (i.e., as language brokers), raciolinguistic socialization in the school, language socialization processes in multilingual workplaces, forms of accent discrimination that adults face, and the challenge of aging in a second language, among other topics. A consistent topic of interest throughout the class is the ideologies that frame Latinx language practices as disordered; we also consider policy, theory and activism that attempts to re-shape these ideologies. Students will complete a final project in which they use our class discussions to analyze an interview they conduct",

Is \"mental\" health/illness distinct from \"body\" or \"physical\" health/illness? Is culture separable and distinct from \"mind/body,\" or \"health/illness\"? Are mental illnesses universal/particular? Are certain categories or classes of persons, groups, or societies less or more \"protected\" from or \"vulnerable\" to certain mental illnesses?

  "description": "Students explore various historical and contemporary processes that have created Africa's diverse and complex geography. The course begins with a historical survey of the continent, starting with its great civilizations and continuing through its experiences through colonialism, independence, the cold war, and globalization. This section of the class examines how these major events have played out throughout the different regions of Africa, south of the Sahara. The class then turns directly to thematic issues that are central to a human-geographic perspective of the continent: population, rural/urban dynamics, education and health issues, and human-environment interactions including agricultural systems and conservation issues. Finally, with a deeper understanding of the region, the course addresses present-day political hot spots of post-cold war Africa, and the critical development problems plaguing the continent",

  "description": "Environmental history offers an earth's-eye view of the past, by addressing the many ways in which humans have interacted with the natural environment over time. How has the environment shaped the course of human history, and how have human actions and attitudes shaped the environment? And how does studying past environments help us understand our present-day challenges? All too often, historians study the human past without considering nature; similarly, all too often, scientists study nature without considering human history. We will explore the value of integrating these different perspectives, and argue that a historical perspective is absolutely crucial if one hopes to understand contemporary environmental issues",
