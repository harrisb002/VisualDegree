      "description": "The master of arts in Cultural Resources Management (CRM) involves the identification, evaluation, and preservation of cultural resources, as mandated by cultural resources legislation and guided by scientific standards within the planning process. A key goal of the master's program in CRM is to produce graduates who excel in the methods and techniques employed by heritage professionals, and who have the theoretical background necessary for research design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation\nPersons with an M.A. in CRM will be qualified to hold management and supervisory positions within all sectors of the heritage industry. Graduates meet the qualifications for professional certification in the United States, but are also well grounded in international heritage legislation and practice\nThe CRM program emphasizes\n1. Experience in all aspects of regulatory CRM, from project development to execution, consultation, and community engagement.\nExperience in conducting identification and analyses of archaeological, historical, osteological, geoarchaeological, geospatial, architectural, linguistic, and sociocultural data to implement environmental protection and historic preservation legislation in both the public and private sectors.\nTraining in the professional traditions of inquiry within anthropology, history, geography, and environmental planning to identify heritage resources, assess their research and preservation significance, and determine appropriate courses of action.\nExperience with the techniques, regulations, and guidelines for field and laboratory data collection, analysis, reporting, and management. \nExperience with archival preparation, data and artifact storage, curation facilities, and public interpretation\n1. Experience in all aspects of regulatory CRM, from project development to execution, consultation, and community engagement\n1.

Experience with the techniques, regulations, and guidelines for field and laboratory data collection, analysis, reporting, and management\n1. Experience with archival preparation, data and artifact storage, curation facilities, and public interpretation\nStudents in the program, under the supervision of a primary faculty advisor, develop a plan of study and thesis project that reflects their particular interest in CRM. In addition, students are encouraged to present the results of their work and research in professional meetings, research publications, and public documents\nFacilities and Faculty\nCRM faculty teach, advise and serve as thesis committee members and chairs in the CRM program. Our core faculty are professors in the department of Anthropology. Their expertise is in heritage legislation and policy, prehistoric and historical archaeology, material culture, bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology, spatial analysis, remote sensing and other digital technologies. Affiliated CRM faculty, serving in other departments on campus (e.g., History, Geography, Environment, and Planning), regularly teach supporting courses and can also serve as thesis committee members\nThe Anthropological Studies Center (ASC), an affiliated CRM organization within SSU, provides students with the opportunity to gain real world experience in contract and grant-based prehistoric and historical archaeology, geoarchaeology, tribal consultation, community engagement, oral history, and collections management. The ASC has more than 5,000 square feet of office, laboratory, and curation facilities and is supported by a full-time professional staff, many of whom are past graduates of the M.A. in CRM program. Internships for graduate and undergraduate students at the ASC are offered regularly\nAnthropological Studies Center (ASC)\nASC\nThe Northwest Information Center (NWIC), an adjunct of the State Office of Historic Preservation, manages historical records, resources, reports, and maps; supplies historical resources information to the private and public sectors; and compiles and provides a referral list of qualified historical resources consultants. Internships for graduate and undergraduate students at the NWIC are also offered regularly\nNorthwest Information Center (NWIC)\nNWIC\nRequirements for the Degree\nAll students in the cohort-based program complete a set of courses totaling 30 academic units, including a required core of 24 units, and an additional 6 units of supporting coursework. Each student, under the supervision of a primary faculty advisor, develops a plan of study and thesis project that reflects their interests or desired areas of specialization. The program is typically completed in six to seven semesters, although faster completion is possible. Ideally, coursework proceeds in conjunction with a student's developing interests and expertise, so that by the time they are ready to write a thesis prospectus, the completed courses help focus the upcoming research project\n"

The strategic decision-making emphasis includes courses like Financial Statement Analysis, Strategic Marketing, and Operations and Supply Chain Strategies, and culminates in an integrative, applied-learning capstone project. Incorporating experiential and project-based learning, the Executive MBA includes a multiple day intensive off-site experience which guides students in exploring team and leadership dynamics and a 10-day international learning journey that includes in-country consulting projects and business visits with executives and government officials\nThe Executive Wine MBA offers our EMBA curriculum to wine industry professionals, featuring projects and assignments focused on wine businesses, and faculty with backgrounds in wine industry research and practice\n"

By taking courses in all four subfields (archaeology, biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, and linguistic anthropology), students learn to formulate theoretical and practical questions, and collect, organize, and interpret data. The combination of knowledge about human ways of life and training in analytical skills are crucial to any field dealing with human biology, society, and culture. This perspective is invaluable in preparing students for careers in a wide range of professional fields, including cultural resources management, environmental planning, education, public health, business, law, community development, and international service\nNote: A maximum of 12 transfer units in lower-division courses can be used to complete the 40-unit anthropology major options and advisory plans\nNote: A maximum of 12 transfer units in lower-division courses can be used to complete the 40-unit anthropology major options and advisory plans\nStudents must earn a C- or better in any course applied to the major\nStudents must earn a C- or better in any course applied to the major\n"

Upper-division Business students can also study away during the Fall semester of their senior year, but should keep in mind that they must complete their senior capstone course (BUS 491) at SSU.  Students should work closely with their Business department Area Chair to work out an acceptable course plan for their study away experience\n"

      "description": "The Art History program teaches students to think critically about art and visual culture. In addition to preparing them for careers in the museum and gallery world as well as graduate work in Art History or related fields in humanities, the program offers training in research, writing and critical thinking that will serve them in many professions. Students are given an introduction to western and non-western art before taking more specialized courses that focus on the art and culture of particular regions, periods or themes. Students will gain familiarity with critical theory, historical methodology and research using print, online, and electronic sources. Professors work closely with students to hone their writing, critical thinking and research skills and enable them to cultivate and express their own ideas about art and visual culture\nMany of the courses required for the degree have prerequisites. Consult course descriptions for details\nNote: Reading comprehension of at least one foreign language is essential for Art History majors. Students are advised to develop competence in French, German, Italian, and/or Spanish; however, the prospect of eventual specialization may make other languages advisable in particular instances\nNote: Reading comprehension of at least one foreign language is essential for Art History majors.

      "description": "The Education Specialist Intern Program at Sonoma State University is a partnership with the North Coast School of Education's (NCSOE) Intern Support and Supervision program, a state approved university-based program. This program allows the intern to complete the requirements for a Preliminary Education Specialist (ES) credential concurrent with their first year or two in a paid special education teaching position. The program includes coursework at the university, university supervision in the K-age 22 classroom, a district support provider, and special support seminars provided by Intern Support and Supervision Program. Completion of an internship program results in the same credential as is earned through the traditional teacher preparation program\nTo qualify for an internship program, an individual must\n1. Be formally admitted to the university and the ES program;\nPossess a bachelor's degree;\nSatisfy the U.S. Constitution requirement;\nHave a job offer as a special education teacher;\nSuccessfully complete the Intern Application Evaluation which includes approval from the Special Education Program faculty and the School of Education Credential Analyst; and\nMeet Pre-Service Requirements\n1. Be formally admitted to the university and the ES program\n1. Possess a bachelor's degree\n1. Satisfy the U.S. Constitution requirement\n1. Have a job offer as a special education teacher\n1. Successfully complete the Intern Application Evaluation which includes approval from the Special Education Program faculty and the School of Education Credential Analyst; and\n1. Meet Pre-Service Requirements\nThe Intern Application Evaluation form verifies that these requirements have been met and is available online at www.sonoma.edu/education/else/preliminary-education/es-internship.html or in the School of Education\nInterns are bound by the same program requirements, policies and procedures as all ES candidates except for the student teaching requirement. Instead of student teaching in the final semester of the program, which is typical in the ES credential program, interns are provided with university supervision in their K- age 22 classrooms throughout their internship, typically ranging between two and three semesters. Supervision includes candidates attending the intern or PIP/STP seminar (EDSP 480 or EDSP 481) where they meet with their supervisor and other interns to discuss their classrooms while bridging theory and practice, gathering suggestions and support, and discussing topics that are applicable to their current teaching situations. (Note that EDSP 480, support for candidates on PIP or STP teaching permits are NOT intern teachers. Becoming an intern requires meeting additional requirements)\nBecause of the increased responsibilities that an internship demands, interns are not allowed to take more than 12 units each semester. This sometimes alters an ES candidate's original program plan, delaying completion of the credential program by one or two semesters. The intern credential is valid for up to two years, provided the intern continues to be enrolled in university classes and employed as a special education teacher. It is important that the intern completes both the university course work and all statutory requirements before the intern credential expires. Interns who do not hold a previous multiple or single subject credential must also pass the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) as part of their statutory requirements\nEmployment Verification\nEmployment Verification\nEmployment must be verified by a letter of employment, on official letterhead from the employing school or district, verifying the date employment began, the type of assignment and location, and whether it is a full time or part time position (if it is part time the letter needs to specify the percentage of time you will be working)\nIntern Application Interview\nIntern Application Interview\nThe Intern Coordinator conducts the intern application interview. The interview evaluates the candidate's academic achievement, progress, professional dispositions and responsibilities\nPlease note: eligibility and admissions requirements to the Intern Program are subject to change. Please contact the Intern Advisor for current eligibility and admissions requirements\n"

The Credential authorizes the holder to serve as a vice principal, principal, coordinator, program director, superintendent, or in other district or county level positions. The Intern Credential authorizes individuals to serve in administrative positions while completing the approved Preliminary program of study. Areas of competence addressed in each program are developmental and expand upon prior learning and experiences included in each level of preparation. Throughout all programs, participants progress from concrete applications of what is being studied to more advanced applications of theory into practice that call for the critique and redefinition of one's knowledge base.

In our M.A. program, students critically examine educational theories and research through a variety of empirical and theoretical lenses with a focus on social justice to develop an informed educational vision and innovative pedagogy in a variety of educational settings. Students have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty and colleagues to examine and influence current educational practice through research, project development, and advocacy. We expect graduates to emerge from their work at Sonoma State University as leaders in their field and agents of change\nThe five M.A. in Education areas of concentration offered at Sonoma State University are\n1. Curriculum, Teaching, and Learning (see Department of Curriculum Studies and Secondary Education);\nReading and Language (see Department of Literacy Studies and Elementary Education);\nSpecial Education (see Department of Educational Leadership and Special Education)\n1.

Since most elementary schools are not departmentalized, this credential, in general, is appropriate for the middle/junior high school and high school (art, music, and physical education candidates may teach K-12). The program aims toward two primary goals: (1) to develop the skills and knowledge needed to be an effective beginning teacher, and (2) to establish the professional understandings and attitudes for growth and development throughout a teaching career\nCoursework combined with the field experience in the program will prepare candidates to be\nCompetent in basic classroom skills.\n\n* Knowledgeable and enthusiastic about students, learning, and teaching.\n\n* Respectful of and knowledgeable about cultural, linguistic, and learning diversity, and informed about practices for teaching all students.\n\n* Continue their development as professional educators. After completion of the Single Subject Credential Program, candidates will be recommended for the Preliminary California Single Subject Teaching Credential in a subject area. Successful completion of the program prepares candidates to teach in California's culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms\nStudents may satisfy subject matter requirements by passing the appropriate state approved examinations (CSET), OR by completing California approved Subject Matter program\nThe Single Subject Credential Program is a two-semester program that begins in the fall semester only. Credentials are offered in the following areas\nArt English\nMathematics Music\nPhysical Education Science\nSocial Science World Language\nArt English\nMathematics Music\nPhysical Education Science\nSocial Science World Language\nArt English\nArt\nEnglish\nMathematics Music\nMathematics\nMusic\nPhysical Education Science\nPhysical Education\nScience\nSocial Science World Language\nSocial Science\nWorld Language\nThe Single Subject Credential Program\nThe Single Subject Credential Program\nStudents admitted for the fall semester, who successfully complete all coursework and their final student teaching, will be eligible for the credential in June. Students who wish to take longer than two semesters to complete the credential program may extend their program to four semesters. More information regarding the extended program may be obtained from the Single Subject program advisor at (707) 664-3176\nSingle Subject program courses required for each phase are listed below.

California Multiple Subject Teaching Credential (Basic generalist teaching authorization typical for elementary teachers, though also appropriate for middle and high school teachers working in self-contained classrooms, teaching most or all subjects)\nThis credential authorizes the holder to teach in a self-contained classroom, TK through grade 12 plus adults. It is most frequently used for teaching in elementary classrooms and early childhood settings. The Multiple Subject Credential Program is a two or three semester program with additional prerequisites required\nThe Multiple Subject Program is based on the belief that learning to teach requires building a professional knowledge base honed by practice in varied classroom settings. Thus, our curriculum integrates course work with field study in order to develop practical theory and to promote collaboration between the University and the public schools\nThe Multiple Subject emphasis prepares candidates to teach in self-contained classrooms with significant populations of students who are emergent bilinguals (i.e. \"English learners\") in grades TK-12. This program prepares candidates to provide instruction for language development and subject matter content in English. Because self-contained classes are located primarily in elementary schools, professional course work and field experiences focus on elementary classrooms\n"

For this reason, all of the curriculum courses have been designed to include significant field experiences in schools. In each phase, field experiences are coordinated with one or more academic courses to help establish the relationships between the theories and practices learned at the University and the realities of classroom life.

CORE has grown out of a rich history with roots in the clinical observation, peer coaching, and team models of professional development. CORE draws from this background and incorporates the best characteristics from these models. CORE is purposely structured to give equal voice to all participants, to honor all participants as lifelong learners, and to view all stake holders as co-teachers. The model attempts to breakdown the stereotypes of the ivory tower and to bridge the gap between public school and university educators. Simply stated, everyone is an expert in areas of strength and everyone has something to learn. The Multiple Subject Program has developed a flexible organization for teacher preparation that acknowledges the contribution made to candidates' teacher preparation by public school teachers and administrators. The program purposefully builds in time to meet with mentors at the CORE site, to hear what they are thinking, to implement their ideas into the program, and to learn together. Note, It is not typical for university faculty to commit to spending one day a week in a public school for the purpose of supervising student teachers. That the LSEE faculty eagerly participates in this experience is evidence of the value placed on this aspect of the Multiple Subject Program\n"

These field experiences take place in a school that has been selected as a University/Public School CORE Collaboration Site. During these field experiences, the credential candidates are supervised by both a University faculty member and a mentor teacher who has met specific criteria for selection and who meets with University faculty regularly each semester. Those who opt to complete the program in more than two semesters, the FLEX students, will complete these supervised classroom experiences during their last two semesters. During the two semesters that candidates are placed at a CORE site, they are expected to experience the full range of teaching that one is likely to meet as a salaried teacher: candidates are expected to teach connected reading and language arts lessons, connected hands-on math and science lessons, and culturally relevant multicultural social studies lessons. Candidates are expected to have experience working with individual students, small groups, and whole class instruction. Candidates are expected to prepare curriculum plans that reflect an understanding of first and second language learners' needs and demonstrate sound methodologies and strategies. Candidates are expected to design and carry out curriculum for all learners including those with special needs such as special education students and the students who are gifted, or those who are progressing at a higher rate than is typical. Candidates are expected to use the methodologies, curriculum, and strategies that introduce thematic teaching to help students make connections across subject areas. Candidates are expected to contribute to the building of community in the classroom and their curriculum should reflect sound multicultural principles\n"

      "description": "The mission of the Education Specialist Program is the advancement of excellence within the special education profession. Central to this mission is the crafting of special education preparation programs that reflect evidence-based practice, empirical support, as well as values founded in respect for the dignity, educational progress and improved lives of learners with disabilities. The core values of our program center upon educational and social success as dynamic contributors to quality lives for students with disabilities\nA Preliminary Education Specialist Credential Program is offered in the areas of mild-moderate support needs (MMSN) and extensive support needs (ESN), authorizing the provision of services to individuals in grades K- age 22 in inclusion programs, resource specialist program (RSP) settings, special day classes (SDC), and working with adults. Each credential authorizes the teaching of individuals with many federally defined disabilities, including autism, as well as the teaching of students who are English learners. The emphasis on the level of support an individual needs to be self-determined is what differentiates the MMSN from the ESN. Teachers with an MMSN credential may expect to teach individuals with a range of abilities in academic, social, behavioral, and functional skills. The ESN credential prepares teachers to work with students whose disabilities require more intensive support and assistance to live independently\nEach semester of the Preliminary Education Specialist Credential Program includes a fieldwork component in a local K-22 school setting. School-based practice is a vital part of learning to be an effective special educator\nSuccessful completion of and recommendation for the Preliminary Education Specialist authorizes the candidate to seek employment as a special educator. The Preliminary Education Specialist Credential holder must clear the credential through a Clear Induction program\n"

      "description": "There is a critical need for special education teachers in California and across the nation. With the Early Childhood Studies Integrated Teacher Education program in Special Education (ECS ITEP-SE), you have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Studies and a credential in Special Education in one, intensive four-year program.\n\nThe ECS ITEP-SE program is offered by the Department of Early Childhood Studies and the Department of Educational Leadership and Special Education in the School of Education. The mission of the Early Childhood Studies department is to prepare knowledgeable and caring professionals who are committed to contributing to a just society through high-quality education and social services for all children and families. The mission of the Education Specialist credential programs is the advancement of excellence within the special education profession. Combined, these two departments offer you a strong foundation in developmental principles and the specific skills you need to support students with disabilities in achieving their goals.\n\nCandidates in the ECS ITEP-SE concentration take all general education requirements and core courses in the ECS core curriculum. Students transferring from a community college with an AAT in Child Development will also be able to complete the degree and credential within four years. Students who change majors or transfer with a different major may still declare ECS ITEP-SE, but the program will take longer to complete.\n\nDuring the Sophomore year, students interested in the ECS ITEP-SE must apply for admission to and meet all pre-requisites for the Preliminary Education Specialist Program. Credential courses are taken beginning in the Junior year\n"

The sequence and specific courses given are suggestive; please track your progress using the Academic Requirements Report (ARR) in your MySSU Account, and see an advisor each semester to plan your personal program\nCourses may be interchanged fall and spring semester depending on course offering each semester\nWe strongly recommend that you take a second-year experience course.  Some meet a GE area, or they can count as a university elective.  ECS students especially like EDEC 160, which is a university elective\nWe strongly recommend that you take EDEC 160A and EDEC 160B, the First-Year Learning Community (FLC) for Early Childhood Studies.  Other FLCs may be taken; please check your ARR and work with an advisor to determine how another FLC changes your progress in the General Education program\nLower Division GE Courses may be taken in any order.  However, the following two conditions must be met:  GE Areas A2 and B4 must be completed in the first year, and GE Areas A1 and A3 must be completed by the end of the second year\nUpper division GE courses may be taken in any order after you attain 45 units towards the degree\nSSUpper division courses in the major may be taken in any order, except that EDEC 478 should be taken in the same semester that you graduate\n"

      "description": "Consistent with the mission of the university, the Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) program at Sonoma State strives to prepare students to be learned men and women who are capable of pursuing fulfilling careers in a changing world and to fulfill the undergraduate technical education needs of the community, business, and industry of the North Bay region. A broader mission is to enable graduating engineers to acquire knowledge and experience to prepare them to pursue lifelong learning, advanced study, and leadership roles in business and the community\nThe BSEE program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). It is an innovative program in which the curriculum has been designed to provide students with an education in electrical engineering, electronics, and communications\nThe BSEE curriculum consists of 90 units of major courses in electrical engineering, programming, mathematics, physics, and life sciences and 30 units of general education courses. A 58-unit electrical engineering core includes courses in electrical, computer, electronics, and communications engineering such as circuits, analog/digital electronics, electromagnetic fields, microprocessors, analog and digital communications, and networking, as well as electives in emerging fields such as radio frequency (RF) communication, robotics and computer vision, internet-of-things, field programmable gate array (FPGA), artificial intelligence, semiconductors, antennas, and a capstone project. Upper-level electives allow students to delve more deeply into their areas of interest. Theoretical and practical learning experiences are essential components of any course. The senior-year capstone project gives students the opportunity to consolidate their educational experiences. The curriculum develops students' ability to formulate problems, analyze alternatives, make decisions, and solve problems. Internships and research are encouraged to provide students with real-world experience and enhance their communication and interpersonal skills. A 31-unit basic science core consists of courses in mathematics, physics, and life sciences and has a 3-unit overlap with the electrical engineering core. A 48-unit general education curriculum, of which 18 units are satisfied in the major, includes courses in communication, critical thinking, scientific inquiry, quantitative reasoning, arts, humanities, social sciences, life-long learning, self-development, and ethnic studies\nBSEE Program Educational Objectives\nThe program produces BSEE graduates who\n1. Design creative solutions to electrical engineering problems\n2. Demonstrate professional ethics\n3. Connect to their community and contribute to society\n4. Value lifelong learning and self-improvement as demonstrated by taking part in professional development opportunities\n5. Lead and build teams\nCareer Paths and Opportunities\nThe BSEE program prepares students for exciting careers in industry and for graduate school. The graduates will find opportunities in industries such as\n1. Technology;\nHardware and Software;\nCommunication;\nComputer;\nRobotics and Automation;\nAerospace and Defense;\nAutomotive; and\nIntegrated Circuits\n1. Technology\n1. Hardware and Software\n1. Communication\n1. Computer\n1. Robotics and Automation\n1. Aerospace and Defense\n1. Automotive; and\n1. Integrated Circuits\nAn electrical engineer's job duties can include research and development, designing, testing, sales, marketing, and management. Some examples of job titles are: electrical engineer, hardware engineer, software engineer, computer engineer, design engineer, test engineer, validation engineer, application engineer, field engineer, system engineer, network engineer, project engineer, system analyst, network analyst, project analyst, and project manager\n"

Some cross-listed courses may apply to the degree requirements of both programs. Please contact the department office for more information\nDegree Requirements\nDegree Requirements\nThe program requires completion of a total of 32 semester hours\nThe Culminating Experience requirement can be completed in one of two different ways, referred to as Plan A (thesis), or Plan B (design project). In addition, a student must also demonstrate that he/she has acquired proficiency in written English\nDuration of Program Completion\nDuration of Program Completion\nThe entire Program requires 32 (Plan A and B) semester hours to complete. A full-time student taking 9 semester hours of average load per semester can complete the 32-unit Program in four semesters, and a working professional taking 6 semester hours of average load per semester is likely to complete this program in 6 semesters\nStudent Mentoring Plan\nStudent Mentoring Plan\nEach student in a program is assigned a faculty advisor who helps the student develop a plan of study based on his/her interest. The faculty advisor monitors the student's progress and addresses any difficulties that the student may be having in making satisfactory progress in the program. At an appropriate time, generally midway through the completion of the coursework, the student is advised to choose a master's project guide, who then takes over as the student's mentor. The role of the two mentors is to guide and prepare the student to succeed in the real world and be a leader in his/her field of work\nCulminating Experience through Thesis/Design Project/Lab and Technical Report Experience\nCulminating Experience through Thesis/Design Project/Lab and Technical Report Experience\nAll students are required to complete a culminating experience which may take one of the following forms\n1. Research and Thesis (Plan A)\nDesign Project (Plan B)\n1. Research and Thesis (Plan A)\n1. Design Project (Plan B)\nA supervisory committee is appointed for the students who choose Plan A or Plan B. A supervisory committee consists of three faculty members. One of the three members can be an adjunct faculty. A student interested in choosing Plan A or B chooses a faculty member to be his/her thesis/project supervisor. Subsequently, the faculty supervisor becomes chairman of the student's supervisory committee. In consultation with the faculty supervisor, two other members of the committee are selected\nUnder Plan A, a student chooses to do thesis research and write a thesis under the guidance of the faculty supervisor and members of the supervisory committee\nUnder Plan B, a student chooses to prepare a design project focused on the design of devices, instruments, or systems. As in the case of Plan A, the project is mentored by the student's faculty supervisor and members of the supervisory committee\nUpon approval by the student's supervisory committee, the thesis research or design project may be carried out at the student's place of employment under the supervision of an approved senior scientist/engineer of the company. However, an SSU faculty supervisor must oversee the research/project and regularly examine the student's progress. It is expected but not required, that the results of the research/project will be presented in an appropriate technical conference and/or published in a relevant professional journal\nInternship Requirement\nInternship Requirement\nAs a part of the culminating experience, each Electrical and Computer Engineering, M.S. student is required to do an internship in an industry, university, laboratory, utility company, government organization, etc. The objectives of the internship must be to gain hands-on training in dealing with and solving real-world engineering problems within the scope of the student's plan of study, develop teamwork and presentation skills and develop an understanding of the differences in ideal and real world situations. The internship must be completed within one semester. The number of hours worked as an intern should be at least 45, preferably much more. The supervisory committee's and graduate coordinator's approval must be obtained before starting the internship. After completion of the internship, a report of the performed work and achievements certified by the intern's supervisor must be submitted to the supervisory committee and department for its acceptance\nStudents with industrial experience can petition for a waiver of the internship requirement. However, the petition may be considered by the student's supervisory committee and the graduate coordinator of the Electrical and Computer Engineering, M.S. program only if the student can support the petition with proper supporting evidence that he/she fulfills this requirement based on his/her past industrial experience\nGPA Requirements\nGPA Requirements\nAll Electrical and Computer Engineering, M.S. courses must be completed with a B- or better\nLaboratories\nLaboratories\nThe program has the following eight state-of-the-art laboratories in various areas of interest located in the Cerent Engineering Sciences Complex in Salazar Hall\n1.

      "description": "The Film Studies minor is an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental program that analyzes the theory, history, practice and cultural significance of film. Students will study a broad range of film texts and learn to appreciate a variety of aesthetic and filmmaking practices. Through a critical examination of film, students will also learn to appreciate the moral and aesthetic values of various cultures, ethnicities, races and nationalities. While exploring film's connection with several cultures students will learn to approach film and the cinema in a critical and analytic manner. The film studies minor offers students a flexible curriculum that complements several existing major degree programs in the humanities and social sciences. The minor also constitutes excellent supplementary preparation for graduate study and media or film-related careers. In consultation with their advisor, students can design a minor with an emphasis relevant to their academic and career objectives.\nThe minor consists of a minimum of 18 semester units distributed among a core (7 units) and a choice of electives (11 or more units)\n"

The sequence and specific courses given are suggestive; please track your progress using the Academic Requirements Report (ARR) in your MySSU Account, and see an advisor each semester to plan your personal program\nWe strongly recommend that you take a second-year experience course.  Some meet a GE area, or they can count as a university elective.  ECS students especially like EDEC 260, which is a university elective\nWe strongly recommend that you take EDEC 160A and EDEC 160B, the First-Year Learning Community (FLC) for Early Childhood Studies.  Other FLCs may be taken; please check your ARR and work with an advisor to determine how another FLC changes your progress in the General Education program\nLower Division GE Courses may be taken in any order.  However, the following two conditions must be met:  GE Areas A2 and B4 must be completed in the first year, and GE Areas A1 and A3 must be completed by the end of the second year\nUpper division GE courses may be taken in any order after you attain 45 units towards the degree\nTransfer Students\nWork with an advisor to understand how your courses transfer into the major.  If you are missing lower division requirements in the major, make those a priority before enrolling in upper division major requirements\nMeet with the ITEP advisor during orientation so that you can apply to the Education Specialist credential program\n"

      "description": "The graduate program in English at Sonoma State University consists of 34 units of graded work. Literary Criticism, Creative Writing, and Rhetoric/English Education are emphases within the degree available to the student\nAdmission to the Program\nAdmission to the Program\nThe English Department M.A. program accepts applicants only for the fall semester of each year and requires at least a 3.00 GPA in the last 60 academic units taken. Program applicants must file the University application form via Cal State Apply (https://www2.calstate.edu/apply) and have all their academic transcripts sent to the University Admissions and Records Office by the admission deadline set by the department for that year, typically March\nAt the same time, applicants must also upload the following: three letters of recommendation; a brief cover letter indicating the applicant's interest in the program and anticipated field of study (creative writing, literary criticism, or rhetoric/composition); a sample of persuasive prose of between 10 and 20 pages in length; and, for those applying in creative writing, a sample of creative work. These policies and procedures are described in the \"MA in English Handbook,\" which is available online at: http://www.sonoma.edu/english/programs/ma-program.html\nThe English Department Graduate Committee reviews all complete application files that meet campus and departmental admission standards and admits the most qualified of these applicants to the program. Applicants may enter the program with conditional or classified status. Classified status is usually granted to admitted applicants with undergraduate majors in English; conditionally classified status, which requires the completion of 4 to 24 additional units in English, is usually granted to admitted applicants with an undergraduate major in another field. Please see the catalog section on Graduate Degrees for more information\nAdvancement to Candidacy\nAdvancement to Candidacy\nStudents are advanced to candidacy when they have 1) completed 28 units of coursework (except for 6 completion units), and 2) passed either the department's qualifying written exam or the Literature GRE (minimum score at the 65th percentile). Advancement to candidacy is formalized by the filing of a GS01 form with Graduate Studies\nProgram Requirements\nProgram Requirements\nThe M.A. in English requires 34 units. Students complete 28 units through coursework; the remaining 6 will be taken either as thesis units (599) or, for the creative writing track, as directed writing units (535). No more than 4 units of directed writing units (535) may be counted toward the degree prior to the culminating option. Both options require candidates to take English 500 and two 500-level literature seminars. Two courses in English may be taken at the 400 level for degree credit\nResearch assistantship units (460) do not count toward the 34-unit total; nor, except at the discretion of the graduate coordinator, do independent study units (595)\nThose choosing the creative writing option are required to write a creative thesis, together with an introduction, and to give a public presentation of their work. Students in literary criticism and Rhetoric/English Education are required to write a thesis and to defend this project after it has been completed\n"

      "description": "The lower-division General Education program of the Hutchins School consists of First and Second Year Learning Community courses of 6-9 units each covering 2-3 GE categories per per semester. The entire course sequences fulfills, with the exception of mathematics, all of the Sonoma State University lower-division General Education requirements. Courses are open to all SSU students and not restricted to Liberal Studies majors\nThe program courses are as follows\n1. LIBS 101 - The Human Enigma (Fall)\nLIBS 102 - In Search of Self (Spring)\nLIBS 201 - Exploring the Unknown (Fall)\nLIBS 202 - Challenge and Response in the Modern World (Spring)\n1. LIBS 101 - The Human Enigma (Fall)\n1. LIBS 102 - In Search of Self (Spring)\n1. LIBS 201 - Exploring the Unknown (Fall)\n1. LIBS 202 - Challenge and Response in the Modern World (Spring)\nEach of these seminars is made up of a maximum of 15 students and a professor. Learning proceeds by a process of reading, writing, and discussion, in which all students are urged to take an active part. Each seminar is part of a larger learning community that meets together once a week for lectures, field trips, labs, and other group projects. The curriculum for these seminars is developed collaboratively by the faculty facilitating each seminar section, thus drawing on a wide range of disciplinary expertise\nStrongly emphasizing excellence in written communication, the program includes extensive writing projects and regular tutorials. The emphasis throughout is on the critical examination of contemporary problems in their historical contexts. Each student is expected to arrive at conclusions that result from personal reflection and exploration of the ideas of major thinkers in diverse fields\nAt mid-semester, students meet individually with the professor to discuss their progress. At this point, they have an opportunity to reflect on and assess their own learning, a key ingredient in developing the skill of lifelong learning. Students may choose a letter grade or the credit/no credit option. A student taking the course credit/no credit is also given a copy of a detailed evaluation of his or her work, which is placed in the student's Hutchins file. This evaluation assesses the student's cognitive skills, seminar participation, understanding of the course content, writing skills, independent project, and special course assignments. A written commentary addresses each student's particular strengths and indicates the way in which the student should improve in order to become an effective, lifelong learner. Thus, the evaluation conveys a great deal more information than does a single letter grade. Unofficial grades can, at the student's request, be made available to other schools, agencies, or prospective employers who need a quantitative measure of performance if students choose to take the courses credit/no credit. Students choosing the graded option will have their letter grade included as part of their Sonoma State G.P.A\n"

      "description": "The Saturday Hybrid BA Degree Completion Program is designed for those who have completed junior transfer requirements. It offers an alternative route to a Bachelor of Arts degree for working adults or others whose schedules do not permit them to attend regular campus classes. Instruction is organized around one on-campus meeting for a full Saturday each month, combined with weekly online discussions and ongoing reading and writing assignments\nCoursework in the program is designed to investigate current issues and to allow students to explore their own interests. Students stay with their cohort throughout the program as different professors guide the seminars each semester\nThis Special Sessions program is a partnership between the School of Arts and Humanities and the School of Extended & International Education (SEIE). As a self-support program, unique, separate fees are charged on a per-unit basis for all courses required for this program. These fees are set annually by the SSU President. Information about fees, admission requirements, and student support services is available through SEIE. Academic criteria for the program are determined in accordance with all applicable SSU and CSU policies. Degrees are awarded by the School of Arts and Humanities\nLearning Objectives\n\nLiberal studies graduates will have well-developed skills in\nLearning Objectives\n1.

      "description": "The CSU approved and articulated Hutchins Lower-Division Interdisciplinary G.E. Program fulfills all of the Sonoma State University lower-division general education requirements, with the exception of Area B4 Math. Upon completion of the lower-division General Education course sequence, students may elect to continue in the program as a liberal studies major, or they may transfer into another major.  The program consists of four interdisciplinary courses of 9 units each that cover 3 General Education Areas, taken in successive semesters as follows\nLIBS 101: The Human Enigma (Fall): covers GE Area A1, A2, C1\nLIBS 102: In Search of Self (Spring): covers GE Area C2, D1, E, and the US History graduation requirement\nLIBS 201: Exploring the Unknown (Fall): covers GE Area A3, B1, C2\nLIBS 202: Challenge and Response in the Modern World (Spring): covers GE Area B2+B3, D1, the US Constitution, CA State and Local Government, and Critical Race Studies graduation requirements\nStudents in LIBS 101 and LIBS 102 are co-enrolled in LIBS 103: Introduction to Hutchins. LIBS 101 students may also choose to enroll in a writing support course, LIBS 100: The Craft of Writing, on the English Directed Self-Placement survey\nSeminars meet twice weekly in a group of 15 students and a professor. Learning proceeds by a process of reading, writing, and discussion, in which all students are urged to take an active part. There are generally four to six sections of each seminar offered simultaneously, so that each seminar is part of a larger learning community cohort that meets together in a weekly symposium for lectures, field trips, labs, and other group activities and projects. The course curriculum is developed collaboratively by the faculty, drawing on a wide range of disciplinary expertise\nThe emphasis throughout is on critically examining contemporary problems in their historical contexts. Each student is expected to arrive at conclusions that result from personal reflection and exploration of the ideas of major thinkers in diverse fields. Through this process of active learning, students acquire excellent critical thinking, written and oral communication skills\nAt mid-semester, students meet individually with the professor to discuss their progress. LIBS 101 is graded credit/no credit. At the end of the semester, students are given a written evaluation of their work, which is placed in the student's Hutchins file. In LIBS 102, 201 and 202, students may choose a letter grade or the credit/no credit option. SSU policy states that a mark of Credit is equivalent to at least a letter grade of C-; therefore, in LIBS 101, 102, 201, and 202, a mark of Credit is the equivalent of at least the letter grade of C-. Unofficial grades can, at the student's request, be made available if they choose the credit/no credit option\n1.

      "description": "Coordinator\nMichaela Grobbel\n\nemail: grobbel@sonoma.edu\nThe special major in German Cultural Studies offers students an interdisciplinary B.A. that incorporates language courses required for the German minor plus courses in other disciplines. It enriches students' academic and career opportunities by providing them with important skills to find employment in our increasingly interconnected world. The special major prepares students for international or cross-cultural careers in the USA or abroad that require a basic knowledge of the German language, history and culture as well as skills in cross-cultural communication. Recognizing the increasing interconnections in our global world, and Germany as one of the key players within the EU and in the international arena, the B.A. program prepares students for graduate school and careers in a field of their interest. Please review the Sample Four-Year-Plans that suggest two different pathways: \"Track A\" offers a pathway for students who study abroad for one year, and \"Track B\" suggests a pathway for students who do not study abroad\n\"Track A\"\n\"Track B\"\nRequirements for the Special Major\nAs part of the major core requirements, students must complete an internship in the U.S. or abroad, and a senior project. Additionally, students must pass the \"Goethe-Zertifikat B1\"-Proficiency Examination, the internationally recognized language certificate offered annually at SSU under the auspices of the Goethe Institute\n"

One part of the examination will test breadth of knowledge in biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and geology. Another part of the examination will test depth of knowledge in a particular area, such as geology. The B.S. in Geology or the B.A. in Earth Science degrees are recommended to prepare for the part of the examination that tests depth of knowledge in geology. For recommended course selection to help prepare for the part of the examination that tests breadth of scientific knowledge, please see the Teaching Credential section of the SSU catalog. GEOL 107, Introduction to Earth Science, is specifically designed for students who are preparing to take the CCTC single-subject exam.

German helps students understand themselves as participants in their own culture. It also helps them understand U.S. history and culture, since German-Americans represent the largest single heritage population. Moreover, German is the most widely spoken language in Europe. Knowing German also opens up opportunities to connect with more than 120 million native speakers worldwide. Additionally, the study of German prepares students to be competitive for graduate school, since many graduate programs require or recommend German. German minors may also have a distinct advantage entering a professional career, in fields such as international business, economics, science, history, global studies, music, or teaching. The SSU German program offers a variety of courses that provide students with linguistic skills and cultural knowledge of the German-speaking world. Students are encouraged to participate in the CSU International Programs and take courses in Germany, which may be counted toward the minor. Students wishing to study abroad are strongly encouraged to consult with their German advisor to ensure that courses taken abroad can be applied to the German minor. A minimum of 8 of the 21 required units must be taken at SSU\n"

Distance learners can also benefit from this unique arrangement; upon approval by the graduate coordinator, up to 9 units of upper-division or graduate-level electives may be taken at another accredited college. Program faculty include both SSU Spanish faculty and visiting faculty from other colleges teaching in their area of specialization\nThis Special Sessions program is a partnership between the School of Arts and Humanities, and the School of Extended & International Education (SEIE). As a self-support program, unique, separate fees are charged on a per-unit basis for all courses required for this program. These fees are set annually by the SSU President. Information about fees, admission requirements, and student support services is available through SEIE. Academic criteria for the program are determined in accordance with all applicable SSU and CSU policies. Degrees are awarded by the School of Arts and Humanities\n"

Students who study French at SSU also have the option of completing a portion of the course work in France (Paris or Aix-en-Provence) or in Canada, and should visit the International Programs Office for details\nNote: Students should note the prerequisites for upper-division courses\nNote: Students should note the prerequisites for upper-division courses\n"

      "description": "The discipline of Physical Science is concerned with the study of the physical world around us. It primarily concerns non-living systems and includes the fields of Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry, and Geology. The Bachelor of Arts in Physical Science is a flexible STEM degree with a strong Liberal Arts basis. All students in the major take not only several courses in algebra and trigonometry-based physics, but also an array of courses in other fields of Physical Science and related Natural Science. The general program is very flexible, allowing students to choose Physical Science electives most relevant to their  individual career goals. Alternatively, there are two optional concentrations: Teaching and Foundational Health. The Teaching concentration is intended for students working to teach Foundational General Science. Students will only be admitted to the Foundational Health concentration if they have already completed BIOL 115 or BIOL 110, BIOL 220, and BIOL 224. This concentration is intended for students interested in blending their Health background with a broad Physical Science education\n"

For continuing students, please see the following description\nThis program is going on hiatus for 2020-21, and will not be accepting admissions.  For continuing students, please see the following description\nThe Psychology Department, working in conjunction with the School of Extended and International Education, offers a Masters of Arts in Psychology with a depth psychology emphasis. This Special Sessions program is a partnership between the School of Social Sciences and the School of Extended & International Education (SEIE). Academic criteria for the program are set by the department and are determined in accordance with all applicable SSU and CSU policies. As a tuition, self-supported program, unique and separate fees are charged on a per-unit basis for all courses required for this program. These fees are set annually by the SSU President. Information about fees, financial aid and scholarships are available through SEIE. Degrees are awarded by the School of Social Sciences\nCurriculum in Depth Psychology\nCurriculum in Depth Psychology\nThe curriculum offers a strong, supportive small-group learning environment within a structured 36-unit two-year curriculum. In the first year, the 12-15 students take four foundational courses\nThe Theories course explores the basic concepts of Jungian psychology, which is an in-depth language for understanding psychological development and creative expression. The Methods and Applications course teaches the techniques of depth inquiry, which are methods for accessing, exploring and understanding the hidden parts of the self. This is accomplished through intensive work with different symbolic forms, such as dreams, art, active imagination, sandplay, movement, myth, nature, and the body. The Cross-Cultural Mythology and Symbolism course focuses on common archetypal motifs across cultures as expressed in image, myth, fairy tale, ritual, rites of passage, and indigenous practices. The Research Methods course explores depth inquiry methodologies and develops skills in reviewing the literature, conducting a study, and interpreting the findings\nIn the second year, students develop a research proposal for their culminating Master's requirement and begin implementing their study in the fall Culminating Paper Tutorial. In the spring students complete their study and prepare for the public presentation of their work in the Article Evening in May. Students have a choice of completing an article of publishable quality or a master's thesis focused on an area of passionate interest. Students choose seminars in depth psychology oriented around student interests. Past seminars have explored individuation; earth-based rites of passage; expressive arts; trauma; transformational teaching; neuropsychology; typology; and object relations\nThe second year internship offers students community work experience in their field of interest, such as teaching, the arts, mental health, ecopsychology, and rights rites of passage. Students may apply to teach an undergraduate course in their field of expertise in the SSU Psychology Department as an internship. Past student- taught courses include cross-cultural rites of passage; myth and narrative; and indigenous wisdom. The Program coordinator assists students in developing curriculum and supervises the teaching internship\nStudents also have the option, at additional expense, of enrolling in University courses that meet their specific learning needs. After completion of coursework, university policy requires students in master's programs to maintain continuous enrolment until completion of the M.A. program. A maximum of 10 academic units may be taken post-coursework. Students may sign up for 3 semesters of PSY 578, Project Continuation, and then renew thesis units with 3 units of PSY 599, Masters Thesis, at the current tuition rate. There is a 7-year limit on coursework for the M.A\nThe Master's program sponsors a monthly Saturday lecture series open to the public that invites noted authors, therapists, and practitioners to come and discuss their work. Past presentations have included discussions of emotion and the archetypal imagination; spirituality; archetypal masculine and feminine; sandplay case studies; images of enlightenment; and psychological initiation\n"

      "description": "A major in Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) enables students to explore the social, political, and cultural dimensions of gender and inequity. WGS is the study of how gender structures everything from our innermost sense of self to transnational circuits of society and economy. WGS uses an intersectional perspective, which means that we understand gender to be co-constituted with race, ethnicity, sexuality, nation, ability, and other forms of social power. We use an interdisciplinary approach that examines social structures, institutions, and ideologies of gender through social, historical, political, legal, and cultural lenses\nEmphasizing the connections between theory and practice, Women's and Gender Studies encourages applied learning through internships, service learning, cultural production, and research.  The WGS Department's general education courses and lecture series produce campus-wide transformative consciousness, while our major courses further depth and engagement. WGS classes are places where students can strengthen critical awareness and build community\nA major in WGS empowers students to understand and engage in building a more equitable world. An intersectional feminist analysis facilitates critical exploration of power, difference, and the production of knowledge. It also compels us to envision more just alternatives and commit to transformative action\n"

The program recognizes the need for a strong combination of theoretical and practical learning. Students choose from two concentrations: Public Management (PM) or Non-Profit Agency Management (NP)\nEach student is required to complete a 20-unit analytic core, a 16-unit concentration, and 4 units of graduate-level electives. Courses are based upon the professional curriculum established for public administration programs by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA). Concentrations include specialized courses oriented toward the operation and management of public and nonprofit agencies and typically include fiscal management, personnel administration, legal issues, public policy, labor relations, marketing and resource development for nonprofits, and grants and contract management. Electives cover a wide range of important topics, including ethics, leadership, organizational computer usage, internships, and special studies\nUp to 9 units of comparable graduate course work may be transferred into this program per CSU policy\nIf at any time it is determined that the candidate has an English deficiency, extra courses in English will be required in addition to the regular course of study\n"

WGS is the study of how gender structures everything from our innermost sense of self to transnational circuits of society and economy. WGS uses an intersectional perspective, which means that we understand gender to be co-constituted with race, ethnicity, sexuality, nation, ability, and other forms of social power. We use an interdisciplinary approach that examines social structures, institutions, and ideologies of gender through social, historical, political, legal, and cultural lenses\n"

      "description": "All internships are credit/ no credit. A minimum of 8 credit/ no credit units may count toward the 40 psychology-major units (psych 499)\nThe Psychology Department strongly recommends community internship experience, particularly for the student going on to counseling clinical/psychology master's and doctoral degrees\nEach semester students may participate in field placements and internship work experiences in organizations and agencies. These internships involve on-the-job training by the agency as well as academic work under the supervision of the psychology Internship coordinator, Dr. Mary Schinder. This experience forms an important base for academic credit and helps students to obtain a range of learning experiences not otherwise found in the department. Students must begin the internship process the semester prior to starting their actual internship.  This includes: attending an internship informational meeting, obtaining a PSY 499 syllabus, setting up internship placement, completing an internship agreement form and providing the agency supervisor with our supervision information letter. See internships updates on our Internships webpage http://web.sonoma.edu/psychology/internships/. Students planning on graduate work in clinical or counseling psychology are encouraged to gain internship experience well before applying to graduate school\nCheck the psychology department for updates on Teaching Assistantships\nResearch and Teaching Internships\nResearch and Teaching Internships\nThe Psychology Department strongly recommends research assistant for those students going on to graduate work in psychology at the master's or doctoral levels. Many university graduate programs require students to have experience in conducting psychological research, as well as in analyzing data and writing up the results. In order to find out more about these research opportunities, students should consult with individual faculty members who are mentoring students in faculty research projects\nSome Psychology Department instructors offer teaching internships to advanced students who have taken and excelled in a course. Duties include working with the classroom instructor in class preparation and classroom tasks, and facilitating small group work. Teaching Assistants register for Psy 482, Teaching  Internship (C/NC)\nCheck the psychology department for updates on Teaching Assistantships\n"

      "description": "The Theatre Studies concentration in the Theatre Arts & Dance program provides equal parts professional theatre training and liberal arts education. Students prepare to pursue theatre careers in directing, playwriting, criticism, teaching, scholarship, arts management, dramaturgy, and other careers that may not have performance or theatre technology at their centers. Regardless of eventual profession, the concentration provides the intellectual rigor and imaginative excitement necessary to any liberal arts degree. Students learn to make theatre as a fundamentally collaborative story told among artists and community. We believe that this kind of training prepares the student to become the ideal global good citizen, engaged with theatre as a means of ritual and democratic conversation focused on full inclusion of all cultures and identities\nAdmission Requirements\nAdmission Requirements\nThe Department of Theatre Arts & Dance requires all prospective Theatre majors to complete an audition\n"
